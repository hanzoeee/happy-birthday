    <p class="message fade delay1">
      first of all, sorry if this sounds awkward.. i’m really not good at saying sweet things😭  
      words of affirmation just isn’t my love language😂  
      but since it’s your birthday, so let me try (at least once a year, right?)
    </p>

    <p class="message fade delay2">
      anyway, happy birthday!!🥳  
      another year older, welcome to level 25 where adulthood gets slightly more confusing😂  
      i hope you get to spend today laughing, doing whatever makes you happy,  
      and maybe getting spoiled a little because you totally deserve it!
    </p>

    <p class="message fade delay3">
      i hope you celebrate it with your family or your favorite people,  
      eat something delicious, and just enjoy the day!
      oh and yes, 25 is that fun stage between being still young and officially an adult
    </p>

    <p class="note fade delay4">
      anyway, that’s all before i start rambling again.. 
      happy birthday once more, my princess!  
      hope this year brings you a lot of good memories and fun stories to tell🤍  
    </p>

      <p class="message fade delay1">
        okay, here’s the part where i act like a sentimental person for a few seconds😭  
        i just wanted to say that i really appreciate you, you make things so much more fun, 
        you’ve got that mix of humor and chaos that somehow makes every moment better😂  
        thanks for being around and for just being you
      </p>

      <p class="note fade delay2">
        that’s it, no drama, no deep talk, just genuine wishes from me😊  
        go enjoy your day, celebrate, eat lots of cake, and take tons of pictures🎂📸  
        hope this year treats you kindly and gives you plenty to smile about!✨
